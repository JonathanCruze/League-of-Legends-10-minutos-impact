# Context
League of Legends is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) where 2 teams (blue and red) face off. There are 3 lanes, a jungle, and 5 roles. The goal is to take down the enemy Nexus before the enemy destroys yours to win the game.

## Content
This dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level.

Each game is unique. The gameId can help you to fetch more attributes from the Riot API.

There are 19 features per team (38 in total) collected after 10min in-game. This includes kills, deaths, gold, experience, levelâ€¦ It's up to you to do some feature engineering to get more insights.

The column blueWins is the target value (the value we are trying to predict). A value of 1 means the blue team has won. 0 otherwise.

So far I know, there is no missing value.

# Glossary
`Warding totem:` An item that a player can put on the map to reveal the nearby area. Very useful for map/objectives control.

`Minions:` NPC that belong to both teams. They give gold when killed by players.

`Jungle minions:` NPC that belong to NO TEAM. They give gold and buffs when killed by players.

`Elite monsters:` Monsters with high hp/damage that give a massive bonus (gold/XP/stats) when killed by a team.

`Dragons:` Elite monster which gives team bonus when killed. The 4th dragon killed by a team gives a massive stats bonus. The 5th dragon *(Elder Dragon)* offers a huge advantage to the team.

`Herald:` Elite monster which gives stats bonus when killed by the player. It helps to push a lane and destroys structures.

`Towers:` Structures you have to destroy to reach the enemy Nexus. They give gold.

`Level:` Champion level. Start at 1. Max is 18.

## A short data analysis
Histogram for every tag in the data frame:
```python
data.hist(figsize=(20,20), **{"align": "mid"})
```

Correlated values:
```python
sns.clustermap(data.corr())
```

## Separating the data by teams so i can look foword for further conclusions
```python
# Data to plot
labels = ['Blue Team wins', 'Red Team Wins']
colors = ['lightskyblue', 'lightcoral']
slices = [blueCount, redCount]

# Plot
plt.pie(slices, labels = labels, colors = colors, 
autopct='%1.1f%%', shadow=True, wedgeprops = {'edgecolor': 'black'}, startangle=85)

plt.title('Overall Win Rate % per Team [Diamond-Master]')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Looking if there are matches in which a team is winning and then loses
```python
# First for blue threw games
sns.countplot(data=data[data['blueTotalGold'] > 20000], x='blueWins')
plt.xlabel('Red Comeback');
```

```python
# Second for red threw games
sns.countplot(data=data[data['redTotalGold'] > 20000], x='blueWins')
plt.xlabel('Blue ComeBack');
```

- Apparently Red Team throws a little bit more than Blue

## Cleaning data
```python
#GameID isn't important for the algorithm so i decided to remove it
data = data.drop('gameId', axis=1)

# We drop all the variables that are symetric i.e blueKills == redDeaths
symetric_features = ["redFirstBlood", "blueDeaths", "redDeaths", "redGoldDiff", "redExperienceDiff"]

# We drop all the redundant variables. For example, we do not care about the total amount of gold earned, what matters is actually the difference compared to the enemy team
redundant_features = ['redTotalGold', 'blueTotalGold', 'redAvgLevel', 'blueAvgLevel', 'redTotalExperience', 'blueTotalExperience', 'redTotalMinionsKilled','blueTotalMinionsKilled', 'blueKills', 'redKills']

# We drop highly correlated features. For example, the redAvgLevel is logically highly corelated with the 
multicolinear_features = ["redCSPerMin", "blueCSPerMin", "blueEliteMonsters", "redEliteMonsters", "blueGoldPerMin", "redGoldPerMin"]

# Kill difference
data = data.assign(blueKillDiff = data["blueKills"] - data["redKills"])
data = data.assign(redKillDiff = data["redKills"] - data["blueKills"])
# Remaining wards
data = data.assign(blueWardsRemain = data["blueWardsPlaced"] - data["redWardsDestroyed"])
data = data.assign(redWardsRemain = data["redWardsPlaced"] - data["blueWardsDestroyed"])


data = data.drop(symetric_features, axis = 1)
data = data.drop(redundant_features, axis = 1)
data = data.drop(multicolinear_features, axis = 1)
```
Looking for high and low impact on determinating the Win condition 
```python
data.corr()["blueWins"].drop("blueWins").sort_values().plot(kind = "bar")
```

```python
data.shape
